abstract = {The problem of finding good preconditioners for the numerical solution of a certain important class of indefinite linear systems is considered. These systems are of a 2 by 2 block (KKT) structure in which the (2,2) block (denoted by -C) is assumed to be nonzero. In Constraint preconditioning for indefinite linear systems , SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 21 (2000), Keller, Gould and Wathen introduced the idea of using constraint preconditioners that have a specific 2 by 2 block structure for the case of C being zero. We shall give results concerning the spectrum and form of the eigenvectors when a preconditioner of the form considered by Keller, Gould and Wathen is used but the system we wish to solve may have C neq 0 . In particular, the results presented here indicate clustering of eigenvalues and, hence, faster convergence of Krylov subspace iterative methods when the entries of C are small; such situations arise naturally in interior point methods for optimization and we present results for such problems which validate our conclusions.

Here we focus on the widely used class of collective point smoothers. These methods are constructed by a point-wise grouping of the unknowns leading to, e.g., collective Richardson, Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel relaxation methods. Their smoothing properties are well-understood for scalar problems in the symmetric and positive definite case. In this work the analysis of these methods is extended to a special class of saddle point problems, namely to the optimality system of optimal control problems. For elliptic distributed control problems we show that the convergence rates of multigrid methods with collective point smoothers are bounded independent of the grid size and the regularization (or cost) parameter.},

abstract = {We discuss the use of preconditioned conjugate gradients (CG) method for solving the reduced KKT systems arising in interior point algorithms for linear programming. The (indefinite) augmented system form of this linear system has a number of advantages, notably a higher degree of sparsity than the (positive definite) normal equations form. Therefore, we use the CG method to solve the augmented system and look for a suitable preconditioner. An explicit null space representation of linear constraints is constructed by using a nonsingular basis matrix identified from an estimate of the optimal partition in the linear program. This is achieved by means of recently developed efficient basis matrix factorisation techniques which exploit hyper-sparsity and are used in implementations of the revised simplex method. The approach has been implemented within the HOPDM interior point solver and applied to medium and large-scale problems from public domain test collections. Computational experience is encouraging.},

abstract = {The solution of quadratic or locally quadratic extremum problems subject to linear(ized) constraints gives rise to linear systems in saddle point form. This is true whether in the continuous or the discrete setting, so saddle point systems arising from the discretization of partial differential equation problems, such as those describing electromagnetic problems or incompressible flow, lead to equations with this structure, as do, for example, interior point methods and the sequential quadratic programming approach to nonlinear optimization. This survey concerns iterative solution methods for these problems and, in particular, shows how the problem formulation leads to natural preconditioners which guarantee a fast rate of convergence of the relevant iterative methods. These preconditioners are related to the original extremum problem and their effectiveness---in terms of rapidity of convergence---is established here via a proof of general bounds on the eigenvalues of the preconditioned saddle point matrix on which iteration convergence depends.},

The Stokes problem describing slow viscous flow of an incompressible fluid is a classic example coming from PDEs and in the area of optimization such problems are ubiquitous. In this paper we present a framework into which many well-known methods for solving saddle-point systems fit. Based on this description we show how new approaches for the solution of saddle-point systems arising in optimization can be derived from the Bramble Pasciak conjugate gradient approach widely used in PDEs and more recent generalizations thereof. In particular we derive a class of new solution methods based on the use of preconditioned conjugate gradients in nonstandard inner products and demonstrate how these can be understood through more standard machinery. We show connections to constraint preconditioning and give the results of numerical computations on a number of standard optimization test examples.},

abstract = {We introduce a novel strategy for constructing symmetric positive definite (SPD) preconditioners for linear systems with symmetric indefinite matrices. The strategy, called absolute value preconditioning, is motivated by the observation that the preconditioned minimal residual method with the inverse of the absolute value of the matrix as a preconditioner converges to the exact solution of the system in at most two steps. Neither the exact absolute value of the matrix nor its exact inverse are computationally feasible to construct in general. However, we provide a practical example of an SPD preconditioner that is based on the suggested approach. In this example we consider a model problem with a shifted discrete negative Laplacian and suggest a geometric multigrid (MG) preconditioner, where the inverse of the matrix absolute value appears only on the coarse grid, while operations on finer grids are based on the Laplacian. Our numerical tests demonstrate practical effectiveness of the new MG preconditione...},

@book{Chen2005,
abstract = {Matrix computing arises in the solution of almost all linear and nonlinear sys- tems of equations. As the computer power upsurges and high resolution sim- ulations are attempted, a method can reach its applicability limits quickly and hence there is a constant demand for new and fast matrix solvers. Precondi- tioning is the key to a successful iterative solver. It is the intention of this book to present a comprehensive exposition of the many useful preconditioning techniques. Preconditioning equations mainly serve for an iterative method and are often solved by a direct solver (occasionally by another iterative solver). Therefore it is inevitable to address direct solution techniques for both sparse and dense matrices. While fast solvers are frequently associated with iterative solvers, for special problems, a direct solver can be competitive. Moreover, there are situations where preconditioning is also needed for a direct solution method. This clearly demonstrates the close relationship between a direct and an iterative method. This book is the first of its kind attempting to address an active research topic, covering these main types of preconditioners. Type 1 Matrix splitting preconditioner FEM setting Type 2 Approximate inverse preconditioner FEM setting Type 3 Multilevel (approximate inverse) preconditioner FEM setting Type 4 Recursive Schur complements preconditioner FEM setting Type 5 Matrix splitting and Approximate inverses Wavelet setting Type 6 Recursive Schur complements preconditioner Wavelet setting Type 7 Implicit wavelet preconditioner FEM setting Here by ‘FEM setting', we mean a usual matrix (as we found it) often formed from discretization by finite element methods (FEM) for partial differential equations with piecewise polynomial basis functions whilst the ‘Wavelet setting' refers to wavelet discretizations. The iterative solvers, often called accelerators, are selected to assist and motivate preconditioning. As we believe that suitable preconditioners can work with most accelerators, many other variants of accelerators are only briefly mentioned to allow us a better focus on the main theme. However these accelerators are well documented in whole or in part in the more recent as well as the more classical survey books or monographs},

@article{Gill1992,
abstract = {Methods are discussed for the solution of sparse linear equations Ky=z, where K is symmetric and indefinite. Since exact solutions are not always required, direct and iterative methods are both of interest. An important direct method is the Bunch-Parlett factorization K = U{\^{}}TDU, where U is triangular and D is block-diagonal. A sparse implementation exists in the form of the Harwell code MA27. An appropriate iterative method is the conjugate-gradient-like algorithm SYMMLQ, which solves indefinite systems with the aid of a positive-definite preconditioner. For any indefinite matrix K, it is shown that the U{\^{}}TDU factorization can be modified at nominal cost to provide and "exact" preconditioner for SYMMLQ. Code is given for overwriting the block-diagonal matrix D produced by MA27. The KKT systems arising in barrier methods for linear and nonlinear programming are studied, and preconditioners for use with SYMMLQ are derived. For nonlinear programs a preconditioner is derived from the "smaller" KKT system associated with the variables that are not near a bound. For linear programs several preconditioners are proposed, based on a square nonsingular matrix B that is analogous to the basis matrix in the simplex method. The aim is to facilitate solution of full KKT systems rather than equations of the form AD{\^{}}2A{\^{}}T Delta pi = r when the latter become excessively ill conditioned.},

@article{Turkel1999,
abstract = {▪ Abstract An overview of preconditioning for the steady-state compressible inviscid fluid dynamic equations is presented. Extensions to the Navier-Stokes equations are also considered. These preconditioners are necessary for many algorithms in order to have the correct behavior at low speeds and to converge to the solution of the incompressible equations as the Mach number goes to zero. In addition, the preconditioning accelerates the convergence to a steady state for problems in which a significant portion of the flow is low speed. This low speed preconditioner can be combined with Jacobi and line preconditioners to damp high frequencies at all speeds. This is necessary for use with multigrid methods. Such combined methods are also better at accelerating problems with high aspect ratios. Details of the implementation are presented including several different variants for the preconditioning matrix.},

More precisely, the multigrid iteration for$\backslash$nthe nonsymmetric and/or indefinite problem is shown to converge at$\backslash$na uniform rate provided that the coarsest grid in the multilevel$\backslash$niteration is sufficiently fine (but not dependent on the number of$\backslash$nmultigrid levels).},

abstract="In this paper we describe an algebraic multilevel extension of the approximate inverse AINV preconditioner for solving symmetric positive definite linear systems Ax=b with the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. The smoother is the approximate inverse M and the coarse grids and the interpolation operator are constructed by looking at the entries of M. Numerical examples are given for problems arising from discretization of partial differential equations.",
